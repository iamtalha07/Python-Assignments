    "Q#1: Define Object Oriented Programming Language?\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming language model in which programs are organized around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior."

    "•\tIt provides a clear modular structure for programs which makes it good for defining abstract data types in which implementation details are hidden.\n",
    "•\tObjects can also be reused within an across applications. The reuse of software also lowers the cost of development. More effort is put into the object-oriented analysis and design, which lowers the overall cost of development.\n",
    "•\tIt makes software easier to maintain. Since the design is modular, part of the system can be updated in case of issues without a need to make large-scale changes\n",
    "•\tIt provides a good framework for code libraries where the supplied software components can be easily adapted and modified by the programmer. This is particularly useful for developing graphical user interfaces."

    "1.\tSimply, function and method both look similar as they perform in almost similar way, but the key difference is the concept of ‘Class and its Object‘.\n",
    "2.\tFunctions can be called only by its name, as it is defined independently. But methods can’t be called by its name only, we need to invoke the class by a reference of that class in which it is defined, i.e. method is defined within a class and hence they are dependent on that class."

    "A class is an entity that determines how an object will behave and what the object will contain. In other words, it is a blueprint or a set of instruction to build a specific type of object.\n",
    "2. Object\n",
    "An object is nothing but a self-contained component which consists of methods and properties to make a particular type of data useful. Object determines the behavior of the class. When you send a message to an object, you are asking the object to invoke or execute one of its methods.\n",
    "3. Attribute\n",
    "Attributes are data stored inside a class or instance and represent the state or quality of the class or instance. In short, attributes store information about the instance. Also, attributes should not be confused with class functions also known as methods.\n",
    "4. Behavior\n",
    "The behavior of an object is defined by its methods, which are the functions and subroutines defined within the object class. Without class methods, a class would simply be a structure.\n"
